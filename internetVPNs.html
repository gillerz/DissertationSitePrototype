            <h1>VPNs and How They Can Protect You</h1>
            <h2>What Is A VPN?</h2>
            Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs for short, act as a way for your device to connect to the internet in a secure way that blocks people's ability to access any data flowing through your device or your internet activity.
            <br>
            They work by routing all data sent and received through an encrypted “tunnel”, acting as a barrier between any third party that wants to view your activity.
            <h2>How Are They Useful?</h2>
            VPNs can be specifically useful for protecting your device when connecting to any network that you are unfamiliar with. Having one on your phone, laptop or tablet could potentially keep your data secure when you are out and about.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Where To Get A VPN?</h2>
            There are a number of VPN providers out there that are safe and recommended.
            <br><br>
            <i>Average Users</i>
            The top 3 VPN providers (at the time of writing, May 2022) are ExpressVPN, SurfShark and NordVPN - however, due to price considerations, SurfShark and NordVPN would be the two recommended options for offering protection at a more affordable price.
            <br>
            Both SurfShark and NordVPN over ad blockers as well as Two Factor Authentication for that extra bit of protection.
            <br>
            Set up for both services is simple, once you have chosen a plan and paid you can install the VPN app, log in and then connect to a VPN or configure your settings to personalise your experience. These settings include options such as booting the app on startup and disabling internet access if you are not connected to a VPN.
            <br><br>
            These VPNs can be found at:
            <br>
            SurfShark - <a href="https://www.surfshark.com/">www.surfshark.com</a>
            <br>
            NordVPN - <a href="https://nordvpn.com/ ">www.nordvpn.com</a>
            <br><br>
            <i>Advanced Users</i>
            <br>
            If using Windows 11, select the <b>Start</b> and search for <b>settings</b>. In the settings page, look for <b>Network & Internet</b> - then choose <b>VPN</b>, and you can manually fill in the details to add and configure your own VPN. For the most amount of control, this is recommended, however not entirely necessary if being used for just a personal device.
