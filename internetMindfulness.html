            <h1>Being Mindful of How Share Online</h1> 
            Thinking about what you share online can help keep you more secure from various forms of identity theft or different types of scams and attacks.
            <br><br>
            Be it fake online personality quizzes or simply oversharing on a public account - scammers will try to find ways to get data from you to be against you later on. Here are some simple steps to in what you should think about when you post online:
            <br><br>
            Firstly, is your account and what you post open to everyone? It may be best to have a look in your privacy settings and ensure that only people you have added or allowed to follow you can see your activity.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, think about what you are sharing - is it an anniversary? A message to a loved one? Your first pet? Your favourite movie? Your old school?<br> these could all be things that you could be using as part of your passwords or security questions - or even simply used by a scammer to try to gain your trust and act as if you may know each other. While slim in chance, it is still important to bear in mind the information that you share.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, make sure you never share your password with <i>anyone</i> online. This includes the likes of teachers and your IT department at work. They have hours in which they can contact you, and if they require you to log in or authenticate something - they can do it personally during those hours. It is always to play it safe and never share sensitive data online.
