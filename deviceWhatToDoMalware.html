            <h1>What To Do If Your Device Is Infected</h1>
            <br>
            In the event that you discover that your device has been infected with malware, there are a few steps you should take immediately to reduce the effects.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, disconnect your device from your network by either disabling WiFi or plugging out the ethernet cable. Then (using the steps found in Device Security>Anti-Virus Protection) run a scan. At this point don’t make a copy of any files or upload them to any external drives if possible as we won’t know what type of malware we could be dealing with and could help it spread.
            <br><br>
            In some instances, your anti-virus will have discovered the issue and sorted it out without your intervention, and all you have left to do is reboot your device and take more precautions when online. However sometimes this may not be the case, and you will have to remove the software yourself as the anti-virus has only detected it. In this case, you should be notified of the file location or of the app that is malware and will have to search for it and uninstall it. After this reboot your PC and monitor it offline, running regular scans just to ensure that the issue is gone.
            <br><br>
            In some especially bad cases, you may need to reinstall your operating system - this will delete anything you have saved on your PC. If there is any sensitive information that isn’t safely backed up you may need to physically write it down to have a copy, it is recommended to check out how to create backups at Device Security>Creating Back-ups. Reinstalling your operating system is straightforward:
            <br>
            <b>Windows</b>: go to settings, then System, then scroll down to “Recovery” and click on that. Here you will see the “Reset PC” option. Click on that and our device will be reverted back to the way it was when you first bought it.
            <b>Mac</b>: click on the Apple menu icon, and go to System Preferences, you will see System Preferences again in the menu bar - click it. Then you will see “Erase All Content and Settings” and will need to enter your password before your device is factory reset.
            <br><br>
            If you are using a laptop, please leave it plugged in during these resetting periods - the device dying during this time could destroy it.
