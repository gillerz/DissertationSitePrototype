            <h1>Creating Back-Ups</h1>
            <br>
            The main reason for creating back-ups is the “just in case” factor - you never want to need them, but it is always worth having them in case of an event such as your device being destroyed or infected with malware. Creating back-ups is relatively simple, especially if you use free services such as Google Drive and Apple iCloud - however out of the two, for the maximum amount of space Google Drive is recommended, giving you 15GB for free instead of iCloud's 5GB.
            <br>
            Here’s how you set them up:
            <br><br>
            <b>Google Drive</b>: A Google drive account is automatically set up for you whenever you create a google account. If you haven’t made a google account, simply go to <a href=”www.google.com">www.google.com</a> and click on the “sign in” button on the page, then click on “create account” and fill in the details as necessary and you will have a google account. To access your google drive, go back to that google main page and you will see a square made of 9 dots on the top right. Click that and you can easily access Google Drive as well as other Google apps. Here you can “drag and drop” files over into your Drive - or create your own files and folders by right-clicking and looking through the options.
            <br><br>
            <b>Apple iCloud</b>: Go to  <a href="www.apple.com">www.apple.com</a> and click on the small shopping bag symbol on the top right corner of the webpage, you will see an option for “sign-in” - click on it and you will be brought to a page asking for your details if you look under you will see an option to create your Apple ID. Fill in the options as necessary and you will be set up with a brand new apple account, allowing you access to iCloud. Sign in to iCloud and you will see an option for iCloud Drive, a place for you to store important documents and files.
