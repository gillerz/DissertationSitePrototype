            <p>This website was created as the artefact as part of a project titled Creating Cyber Security Literature For Less Technically Proficient Users. The purpose of this website is to be a placeholder for guides and literature for people who are interested in keeping themselves and their devices safe when online but arenâ€™t too comfortable with computers.
