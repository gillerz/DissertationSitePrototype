            <h1>How to Deal with Internet Fraud</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>What is Internet Fraud? </h2>
            Internet Fraud is a form of cybercrime where the attacker provides incorrect or fake information or could be using deception for the purpose of tricking victims out of their money or personal data. It has become a commonplace crime throughout the internet - mostly through attacks where users are tricked into falling for fake emails, texts or sometimes websites. The purpose of the attacks is to gain sensitive information from the victim, such as banking details or login details - or can simply be a fraudulent website set up so the victim believes they are purchasing a product.
            <br>
            Dealing with this can sometimes feel embarrassing for a victim, and they may not know how to proceed - so here are some steps to follow in the event that you or someone you know needs help:
            <br><br>
            <h2>Figure out what has been stolen</h2>
            One of the first and most important steps is figuring out what has been stolen. Record all the information you have available about the scam and think of questions such as:
            <br>Did you give over a password?
            <br>Did any information relating to potential security questions given?
            <br>Did you send money?
            <br>Was a bank card used? Was it through PayPal?
            <br>Is there unusual transactions in your account?
            <br><br>
            Making a list of these things can help you work out what you need to do and make a checklist of steps you need to take and potentially people you need to notify.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Update Your Security Settings</h2>
            Updating your security settings should be one of the first steps you need to take to make sure that you are protected. Go through your accounts and make sure that you have an enabled Two Factor Authentication (or 2FA for short). 2FA is a layer of security recommended for accounts with sensitive information - such as emails and bank accounts. It allows you to remain protected even if your password is leaked; anyone trying to get into your account will need access to your emails or your mobile phone.
            <br><br>
            If you use one password for everything then it is highly recommended to make a list of every account you have and go through them all to update your passwords - in this instance having a password manager can save you lots of time. It is highly recommended that if you are using Google Chrome and have a Google account and use their password manager - or go to <b>Device Security, then Managing Passwords</b> on this website and read the information available there.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Notify Your Bank</h2>
            Notifying your bank, or in some cases, Paypal should be one of your top priorities.
            <br>
            As stated before, record the information you have available to you about the scam and what happened. Get in contact with your bank - depending on who you are with this could be over the phone or through a live chat on their website. Let them know what has been compromised - depending on the severity of the case this could simply be the card that has been affected or account details that the scammer may have. They may also recommend updating security on your account, even if the account isn’t compromised, which is highly recommended to accept.
            <br><br>
            If it was a scam that was designed to make you believe that it was your bank contacting you, <b>let them know</b>. This can save future people from being affected and can allow the bank to investigate and notify authorities and their customers.
            The money that has been stolen <i>WILL</i> be refunded to you as part of the Payment Service Regulations 2009 and The Lending Code.
            <br><br>
            <h2>What Else Can Be Done?</h2>
            After you’ve done what you can to protect your accounts and have contacted your bank, speak with Action Fraud, the UKs national service for reporting fraud and similar cybercrime.
