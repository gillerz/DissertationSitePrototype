            <h1>How To Spot Potential Scams</h1> 
            <br>
            Being able to notice identifiers of fake emails and websites could potentially change how you use and interact with the digital world. Here are some key things to look out for.
            <br><br>
            Email scams are one of the most common ways in which people get tricked into giving over their personal information. This can be done either by posing as a company to gain some trust or simply from a made-up email pretending to be some distant relative or a foreign dignitary. There are normally some key indicators that these emails can be scams:
            <br><br>
            Firstly, look at the email address if you are unsure, especially if it is from a company. Compare it to any emails you may have received from the company previously, look for any spelling errors or whether the Top Level Domain (the .com or .co.uk at the end of a website address) to see if it matches what the company normally uses. It can also be worth googling the email address too, as sometimes you may get results saying that the email is a scam or you could find a webpage from the company confirming that it is in fact legitimate. 
            <br><br>
            Secondly, look at the contents of the email. Similarly to looking at the email address, you may find an issue with any website links in the content of the email - again looking for things such as spelling mistakes or TLD changes. Another key thing to look out for when inspecting the links is the “https” at the start of the link - you want to <b>make sure that the “s” is at the end of “https”</b>. The S at the end stands for Secure - it is a certificate given to websites after they have been officially tested; allowing you to be more confident in the fact that it is safe to use. 
            <br><br>
            Lastly, and most importantly, if they ask you to send something - don’t. Unless you know the person that has sent the email or you have confirmed that the email is from the company they say they are, do not send them anything. Whether it’s data, money or files it will always be better to play it safe than to accidentally hand over something sensitive. If everything seems legitimate but you still need to make a payment and feel unsure, always try to use a third party such as PayPal - giving yourself an extra layer of buyer protection.
            <br><br>
            These tips can also be applied to general internet browsing - always be on the lookout for small things such as the “s” after “http”.
