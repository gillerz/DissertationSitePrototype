            <h1>How to Stay Protected With Antivirus</h1>
            <br>
            Anti-virus software is an important piece of software in keeping your device secure. The general purpose of antivirus software is to prevent you from downloading anything that may cause harm, detecting software on your device that may be or is malicious and removing it for you.
            <br><br>
            If you are using <b>Windows</b>, you don’t need to worry about installing any third party - simply go to Settings, then click Privacy & Security and then go to Windows Security. From here you will be met with a suite of options - ranging from your firewall to virus and threat protection. You want to make sure that everything is enabled so that you are as protected as possible. You can also come back here regularly to manually get a scan of your device in case you would like to double-check for any potential malware.
            <br><br>
            If you are using a <b>Mac</b>, you will also have a pre-installed and shouldn’t need to worry about looking for replacements. Similarly to Windows, the Apple equivalent works to scan the device, prevent the launching of potential malware and remediate any damages that have been caused by downloaded malware and remove it from your device. To enable this, open the go to the Apple menu (small Apple logo on the top left of the screen), then choose System Preferences, then the Software Update window and enable “Install system data files and security updates”. There will also be a “check now” option, allowing you to scan again just to make sure.
